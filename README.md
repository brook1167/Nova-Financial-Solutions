# Nova-Financial-Solutions-Data-Analysis

# Business Objective

Nova Financial Solutions aims to enhance its predictive analytics capabilities to significantly boost its financial forecasting accuracy and operational efficiency through advanced data analysis. In this project, the primary task is to conduct a rigorous analysis of the financial news dataset. The focus of the analysis is two-fold:

# Sentiment Analysis:

Perform sentiment analysis on the ‘headline’ text to quantify the tone and sentiment expressed in financial news. This will involve using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to derive sentiment scores, which can be associated with the respective 'Stock Symbol' to understand the emotional context surrounding stock-related news.

# Correlation Analysis:

Establish statistical correlations between the sentiment derived from news articles and the corresponding stock price movements. This involves tracking stock price changes around the date the article was published and analyzing the impact of news sentiment on stock performance. This analysis considers the publication date and potentially the time the article was published if such data can be inferred or is available.

The recommendations leverage insights from this sentiment analysis to suggest investment strategies. These strategies utilize the relationship between news sentiment and stock price fluctuations to predict future movements. The final report provide clear, actionable insights based on the analysis, offering innovative strategies to use news sentiment as a predictive tool for stock market trends.
